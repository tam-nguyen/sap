                  <p>Berlin is, without a doubt, one of Europe’s most-renowned cities, and for very good reason. From
                    its youthful energy and ground-breaking tech scene to its historical architecture and political
                    prestige, this is a city that brims with innovation and character.</p>
                  <p>

                    As part of this social programme, we will explore vestiges of Berlin’s layered past whilst also
                    discovering the promise of Germany’s future. It is celebrated for its engineering feats, its
                    spectacular museums and its magnificent World Heritage Sites, not to mention its world-class
                    culinary
                    scene, arts and culture. From an exciting events calendar to a rich tapestry of pre and post-war
                    architecture, Berlin’s heritage leaves a lasting impression on everyone who spends time here. And
                    attracting close to a million visitors each year, the world-famous Berlin Wall has been dubbed the
                    longest open-air gallery in the world.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Berlin’s past has of course, at times, been dark and complex. This vast metropolis comprises some
                    intriguing and varied layers and has been imaginatively reborn over recent years. The Golden
                    Twenties
                    in particular, was a particularly colourful era for the city. It was during this interwar period,
                    dubbed The Weimar Republic, when Germany’s culture and literature was flourishing. Berliners lived
                    life to the full and the city saw an injection of politically provocative arts, as well as a boom
                    in
                    pioneering work across science and literature. This convivial era, which coincided with hedonistic
                    parties and political freedom, lasted until the inception of Nazi rule and is looked back on with
                    great nostalgia. Today, remnants of Weimar culture can still be glimpsed across the city in the way
                    of retro movie theatres, quirky jazz bars and iconic art institutions. Important monuments which
                    symbolise Berlin’s more promising future following the fall of the Berlin Wall, can also be
                    discovered across the city. The Brandenburg Gate is of course, one of the most famous, and
                    celebrates
                    peace and unity for the country.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The creative spirit is still palpable in Berlin and it now boasts one of the fastest-growing
                    start-up
                    scenes in the world. Offering a true taste of this entrepreneurial culture, Silicon Allee, is
                    located
                    in the heart of Berlin Mitte and is an ‘embassy’ to the city’s thriving start-up scene. Playing
                    home
                    to some of Europe’s most successful innovators, Silicon Allee uncovers inspiring co-working and
                    co-living spaces, exciting independent businesses and a diverse community of tech entrepreneurs.
                    This
                    thriving campus also hosts leading digital conferences and events and is well and truly leading the
                    way for the digital age.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If your heart leads with your taste buds, Berlin will win you over with its exciting culinary
                    scene.
                    No longer limited to the traditional bratwurst and bier, Berlin’s gastronomy has earned prestige
                    amongst food critics from all over the world. From artisanal start-ups to Michelin Star-worthy
                    dining, it is fast becoming a world-class food and drink destination.

                  <p>
                    We are delighted to host you for this special event and we think you will agree, Berlin is a
