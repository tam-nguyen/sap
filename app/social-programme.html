                                    <p>
                                        ‘Enchanting’, ‘mysterious’ and ‘diverse’ are just some of the words used to
                                        describe our location for Saturday evening – and when you arrive, you will see
                                        why.
                                        The Secret Garden is a former cabaret theatre nestled in the heart of Berlin’s
                                        diverse Mitte neighbourhood and harks back to 1905 when Berlin was considered
                                        the
                                        ‘centre of Europe’ for entertainment.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Known in its heyday as the ‘Hummingbird Cabaret’, this beautiful landmark was
                                        one
                                        of the liveliest venues during Germany’s Golden Twenties era and sadly, it fell
                                        into a state of disrepair during the war. However, in 2008, this treasured
                                        venue
                                        was rediscovered, and a real estate company decided to give it a new lease of
                                        life.
                                        The restored structure you see today is a remarkable example of regeneration in
                                        the
                                        city and your evening here will be filled with music, dancing, great networking
                                        and
                                        superb dining. The menu for tonight comes from the three-Michelin starred chef
                                        Dieter Müller, known for his famed Amuse bouche menu and multiple
                                        international
                                        awards. We will close the night with an intimate performance by the man known
                                        as
                                        the ‘greatest living guitarist,’ the Grammy Award-winning, José Feliciano.

                                    <p>
                                        If ever there was a place to recapture the magic of Germany’s Golden Twenties
                                        era,
                                        it’s The Secret Garden in Berlin-Mitte. If the walls of this venue in the
                                        Gartenstrasse could speak, they’d share fascinating tales that hark back to
                                        some of
                                        Berlin’s most vibrant moments in history.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Today, The Secret Garden hosts the most prestigious events and musical
                                        performances. And this evening’s exclusive event will allow us to relive the
                                        charm
                                        that this former variety theatre brought to Berlin during its most convivial
                                        era.
                                        Originally built in 1904 by Oscar Garbe, an architect and entrepreneur, it was
                                        a
                                        hub of entertainment in the thriving Latin Quarter – then part of the Soviet
                                        Union-occupied East Berlin – and went under the name of Fritz Schmidt’s
                                        restaurant
                                        and Kolibri Festsäle. When Berlin entered its lively twenties era, it was known
                                        locally as The Hummingbird ballroom and remained a sought-after cabaret venue
                                        for
                                        another decade. When the war hit, furniture was taken to be used as firewood
                                        and it
                                        fell into a state of disrepair. In the words of the current owners, The
                                        Hummingbird
                                        ballroom ‘sank into oblivion’. No one could have imagined that this iconic
                                        landmark
                                        would ever be so glamorous again.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The man who had the vision was Dirk Moritz, founder and CEO of the Moritz
                                        Group,
                                        who stumbled upon the ruined building’s abandoned backyard while visiting a
                                        public
                                        swimming pool in 2008. The once-opulent venue was now a dilapidated shell
                                        filled
                                        with sofas and rubbish, but the entrepreneur saw through the 30 tons of rubble
                                        and
                                        debris and set about acquiring the site, so he could return the three-storey
                                        venue
                                        to its former glory.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        By 2011 his dream began to become a reality when he secured the property and
                                        four
                                        years later, restoration began. With financial backing from a private bank in
                                        Hamburg, the Moritz Group spent $1.7m transforming the ballroom into a modern
                                        arts
                                        venue and gallery space.

                                        Going by the philosophy ‘the waking of a ruin to new life,’ The Secret Garden
                                        was
                                        created with thoughtful restoration and sustainability in mind. As you marvel
                                        at

                                            an exclusive tour of The Reichstag, home to the German parliament, where we
                                            will be greeted by CDU parliamentary group leader, Ralph Brinkhaus. The
                                            Reichstag has witnessed many of Germany’s most momentous events, spanning
                                            from
                                            the time of the German Empire to the present day, and boasts a rich,

                                        One of the most impressive sights here in Berlin is, of course, The Reichstag.
                                        Located on the southern banks of the River Spree between the Brandenburg Gate
                                        and Central Station, this prestigious landmark, home to the German government,
                                        rises like a beacon above the Berlin skyline and has witnessed some of the most
                                        momentous events in European history. The historic edifice and its striking
                                        glass dome have become an iconic image the world over and today it remains
                                        Berlin’s second most popular attraction, pulling in some 3 million visitors
                                        each year.</p>

                                            Construction of The Reichstag, inspired by the Memorial Hall in
                                            Philadelphia,
                                            began in the late 19th Century and it was finally completed some 23 years
                                            later, thanks to German architect Paul Wallot. The final structure divided
                                            opinions at the time for its eclectic blend of architectural designs, but
                                            with
                                            its glass cupola, imposing columns and decorative motifs, it was one of the
                                            country’s most remarkable feats of engineering and became the official home
                                            of
                                            the Imperial Diet of the German Empire.

                                            The Reichstag fire, an arson attack which took place some 40 years later,
                                            devastated the building, and at the time, many believed that Nazi military
                                            leader Hermann Wilhelm Goring orchestrated the fire in order to consolidate
                                            Hitler’s rise to power. Historians today, however, believe that 24-year-old
                                            Dutch bricklayer Marinus van der Lubbe, was in fact the ‘communist culprit’
                                            behind the blaze. By the time the Second World War hit, The Reichstag had
                                            become an empty, derelict shell with bombs leaving the once-opulent
                                            building in
                                            ruins.

                                            When the Berlin Wall was constructed, and Germany was divided by the Cold
                                            War,
                                            The Reichstag lay within West Berlin, just a few metres away from the
                                            divide.
                                            Various repairs took place on the ruined building, but it wasn’t until the
                                            1990s – when the country reunified and governmental powers were transferred
                                            from Bonn to Berlin – that the German parliament, known as the Bundestag
                                            was
                                            formed and a full restoration began.

                                            It was British architect Norman Foster who was finally appointed to carry

                                            this historical make-over and the innovator behind architectural wonders

                                    <p>
                                        One of the most impressive sights here in Berlin is, of course, The Reichstag.
                                        Located on the southern banks of the River Spree between the Brandenburg Gate
                                        and Central Station, this prestigious landmark, home to the German government,
                                        rises like a beacon above the Berlin skyline and has witnessed some of the most
                                        momentous events in European history. The historic edifice and its striking
                                        glass dome have become an iconic image the world over and today it remains
                                        Berlin’s second most popular attraction, pulling in some 3 million visitors
                                        each year.

                                            Construction of The Reichstag, inspired by the Memorial Hall in
                                            Philadelphia,
                                            began in the late 19th Century and it was finally completed some 23 years
                                            later, thanks to German architect Paul Wallot. The final structure divided
                                            opinions at the time for its eclectic blend of architectural designs, but
                                            with
                                            its glass cupola, imposing columns and decorative motifs, it was one of the
                                            country’s most remarkable feats of engineering and became the official home
                                            of
                                            the Imperial Diet of the German Empire.

                                            The Reichstag fire, an arson attack which took place some 40 years later,
                                            devastated the building, and at the time, many believed that Nazi military
                                            leader Hermann Wilhelm Goring orchestrated the fire in order to consolidate
                                            Hitler’s rise to power. Historians today, however, believe that 24-year-old
                                            Dutch bricklayer Marinus van der Lubbe, was in fact the ‘communist culprit’
                                            behind the blaze. By the time the Second World War hit, The Reichstag had
                                            become an empty, derelict shell with bombs leaving the once-opulent
                                            building in
                                            ruins.

                                            When the Berlin Wall was constructed, and Germany was divided by the Cold
                                            War,
                                            The Reichstag lay within West Berlin, just a few metres away from the
                                            divide.
                                            Various repairs took place on the ruined building, but it wasn’t until the
                                            1990s – when the country reunified and governmental powers were transferred
                                            from Bonn to Berlin – that the German parliament, known as the Bundestag
                                            was
                                            formed and a full restoration began.

                                            It was British architect Norman Foster who was finally appointed to carry
                                            out
                                            this historical make-over and the innovator behind architectural wonders

                                            as the UK’s Wembley Stadium gained worldwide interest for doing so. The

                                            Reichstag building would boast the myriad Renaissance, Postmodern and
                                            Baroque
                                            Revival architecture it was known for, however, this new-and-improved
                                            monument
                                            would draw attention for its technologically innovative designs and become
                                            an

                                            in
                                            LA, Gehry’s creation for Berlin’s Pariser Platz – home of the Brandenburg
                                            Gate
                                            – was never going to blend in. However, the designer had a challenge to
                                            overcome before construction began for this ambitious project in 1998.
                                            Strict
                                            building regulations in Berlin state that any construction in this area
                                            must
                                            not detract from the iconic 18th Century gate. Therefore, Gehry
                                            masterminded a
                                            design in which the most spectacular feature of the building was concealed
                                            from
                                            the outside world. The result is a soaring glass atrium in the centre of
                                            the
                                            edifice, cocooned within a modest limestone façade.</p>

                                            resemble
